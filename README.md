My name is Esther Akinpelu Ololade, a young girl in her teens that finds so much delight in chasing her goals, no matter how hard it seems. Recently, I started taking my coding journey serious, with a high expectation of contributing immensely to the technololgical world. Apart from coding, I am a crochet artist, a fashion designer, poetess, and a podcaster. I still have goals of becoming a skilled guitar and basketball player. I believe in exploring the world because we only get to live it once.
